However, data shows this really isn’t the case. While at the coldest temperatures the total points are low, there are few games where the temperature is extremely low, and the total points increases fast. At higher temperatures, there does not seem to much of a correlation between temperature and total points, for total points ranges across low and high values. To put this data to use, lets use a specific case; in recent times, a narrative about the Miami Dolphins was that they could not play in cold weather, a prime example being their playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2023 - 2024 season. To see if this was really true, we highlight them in the visualization above. It is worthy to note that while we are generally talking about total points, this visualization measures the points of the away team. The scatter plots for away team points and total points are extremely similar, which makes sense sense the points of the away team makes up the total points. Hence, I believe it is reasonable to generalize these results to total points as well. Getting back to the Dolphins, we see their score when they are not at home varies across all temperatures; there does not seem to be a pattern. Thus, while they do have the one bad game that was below 0 degrees, I think the Dolphins really aren’t as bad as people think in cold weather, and play just as good as they do in hotter temperatures.\n\n\n\nHumidity Shows to Be An Even Worse Predictor Than Temperature\nWith humidity not being a great weather trait, many people also believe the higher humidity, the worse teams will do. Unfortunately, data shows this is totally wrong; there looks to be barely any correlation between humidity and total points. So it would not be right to consider humidity to be a good predictor. For another specific case, I looked at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; more specifically, their stadium, Raymond James Stadium. Florida is not as one of the most humid states, so I wanted to see if it had an effect on total points. As you can see, it did not, for the points look to be spread around without real reason or purpose.\n\n\n\nWind Speed Looks to Have a Minimal Effect\nWind is believed to be a large factor on scoring, with higher wind speeds believing to attribute to less accurate kicks and passes. We can see that in total points, winds doesn’t have a significant impact. Although very slight, we can see that, on average, the total points in a game decrease with higher wind speeds. Additionally, in comparing the 0 - 1 MPH group and the 11 - 33 MPH group, there is a more defined difference between the other groups. Thus, I think it would be reasonable to say that higher wind speeds do slightly affect total scores. However, due to how slight the difference is, I think it would do a mediocre job as a predictor.\n\n\n\nTotal Points Scored Don’t Really Change in the Playoffs\nThe Playoffs are the collection of games in the season where the best teams of the season face off, so I thought it would be interesting to see if there was a difference in total points compared to the regular season. Surprisingly, despite the large differences in sample size, the distributions look very similar, and have similar averages. So playoff status would also not be a great predictor of total points. It is worthy to note that the larger amount of outliers present for regular season games is most likely due to the large sample size, an example of a high outlier in recent times being the Broncos V.S. the Dolphins in this 2023 - 2024 season, with 90 total points.\n\n\n\nThe Over-Under Line Shows to Be An Okay Predictor of How Much Points Teams Will Get\nWith the weather and playoff status failing us, it would only make sense to turn to the next most reliable source: the Casinos! Surprisingly, we see the over-Under line actually have some predicting power for total points. As the over-under line increases, so does the total points, and we can see this pretty consistently throughout the graph. Thus, I would say that the over-under line does an actually okay job at predicting total score. As the over-under line is a bet that is literally trying to predict the total points, this makes sense. The red line on the graph represents the cut off for the line: the points below the red line were below the over-under line, and the points above the red line were above the over-under line. It is nearly a 50-50 split. In this specific case of the Chiefs, many, including me, believe that they have acquired some incredible luck or some sort of black magic to win games. Others believe this extends to gambling, and I personally remember hearing many say that they bet on the Chiefs to win this past Super Bowl (59) simply because “Vegas wants them to win.” However, according to this visualization, their black magic, at least for bets of the over-under line, aren’t so magical. As said above, games with the Chiefs only had the total points be under the over-under line half the time, and above it the other half. Thus, their betting black magic is more akin to flipping a coin overall.\n\n\nTotal Points and the Over-Under Line Have Barely Fluctuated Over Time, and Don’t Look Like they Will Anytime Soon\nFinally, I wanted to take a look at total points and the over-under line in order to compare the two throughout the years. We can see that in each season, the distribution of the total points and the over-under line have been similar most of the time. For example, if the distribution of total points for a season were skewed right, the distribution of the over-under line for a season was usually also skewed right. However, for the overall distributions since 2012, we can see their shapes are approximately normal. This leads to the most important point: we can see that over time, except for extreme values, the total points and over-under line fluctuated around the same values. Hence, while the game has changed over time, we don’t really score less or score more than we did a decade ago, and the over-under line also reflects this. While we unfortunately have found no significant ways to surely predict total points, with the trends in recent years, we can be certain that total points and scoring will stay the same for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n",

The CASchools dataset was used, which collected data on elementary schools in California. For this visualization, I used the variables income (average district income), computer (number of computers in a school), and county (counties in California). Specifically, for this visualization I restricted the counties to Kern, Los Angeles, and Tulare. We can see many things with this visualization, with it being rain cloud plots divided by county. For instance, In the case of Los Angeles, we can see there is a larger concentration of schools with an average district income of about 14, with one of these schools having a large number of computers (that point is yellow). Additionally, in comparing the schools of Los Angeles and Tulare, we can say that Los Angeles schools have a higher average district income and more computers on average (all of the points for Tulare are dark blue).\n\n\nConfidence Intervals Dashboard\nFor the intro statistics dashboards project, my group created a dashboard on confidence levels. No external datasets were used, and any numbers / distributions can be manipulated by the user. We sought to include as much interaction as possible for we thought this was the best method for users to better understand the subject of confidence levels. We included many of the basic ideas behind confidence levels and hope that those that are struggling in this topic will better appreciate them after going through our dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucknell Data Story\nI created this visualization on exam #2 in order to show something significant about Bucknell via data visualization. I utilized the CollegeScores dataset, which contained data on colleges in the US. In this visualization, I used the variables FirstGen (percent of first generation students), region (region of country where college is located), and NetPrice (average net price (cost minus aid)). Specifically, I tried to use NetPrice to predict FirstGen. We see a negative relationship present, with an increase in first gen students being associated with a decrease in net price. Bucknell is at the top left of this visualization, meaning it has a high tuition and low amount of first generation students. However, many other colleges of the northeast region are clustered around Bucknell, showing that Bucknell is not the only college that struggles to bring in large percentages of first generation students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Plates VS Small Plates\nI created this visualization on exam #1 in order to visualize the relationship between grams of food ate by an individual and the size of the individual’s plate. I used the plates dataset, which collected data on a study conducted to see if people ate more food if the plate they were given was larger. My visualization aimed to answer this question. Many variables were contained in this dataset, but in order to make this visualization I used g.consumed (mass in grams of food an individual ate) and plate.size (small or large). We see much overlap between the two boxplots divided by plate size, with similar medians, IQRs, shapes, and more. Thus, we were able to conclude that the answer to the research question at hand was no, for individuals who had a large plate ate just about the same as those that had a small plate.\n\n\n\n",
